***Create videos***

The task is to generate videos for all 3D points generated from [Task 2](https://github.com/JYL123/Image-Processing/tree/master/Project/Task2) for each ping-pong ball trajectory. We are asked to create videos of 3D points that we have calculated because visualization is a crucial part of computer vision.
